I'm currently a third-year CSE B.Tech student, and I'm really excited about the field of machine learning. My journey into this fascinating domain started when I took part in a hackathon organized by the SIAM Club, and that's when my interest in machine learning was sparked.

Ever since then, I've been actively working on improving my skills and knowledge in machine learning. I believe in the importance of continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

Through this portfolio website, I want to showcase my projects, skills, and growth in machine learning. I'm eager to use my knowledge and expertise to solve real-world problems and collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations. Please feel free to explore my work and reach out to me for any inquiries, collaborations, or opportunities.
