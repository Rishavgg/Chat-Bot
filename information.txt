Hello, I'd like to introduce myself to you,I'm currently a third-year CSE B.Tech student, and I'm really excited about the field of machine learning My journey into this fascinating domain started when I took part in a hackathon organized by the SIAM Club, and that's when my interest in machine learning was sparked.

As for my education, I have done my Schooling at Army Public School from 2018 to 2019 for my 10th grade, and later, I continued my academic journey at Aklank Public School from 2020 to 2021, where I completed my 12th grade, all while soaking up knowledge and experiences along the way.

My skill set covers a spectrum of expertise, including proficiency in Python and Java, which serve as the bedrock of my coding abilities. In the domain of Machine Learning, I have a comprehensive understanding of various techniques, Machine Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Scikit-learn. In the domain of Deep Learning, my proficiency extends to NLP, TensorFlow, Keras.

One of my proudest achievements was securing the first place in a SIAM JUIT hackathon, where my team and I crafted a remarkable Twitter Sentiment Analysis project, showcasing our innovation and problem-solving prowess.

My goal is to put machine learning to practical use in solving real-world challenges, striving to make a tangible impact where it counts. You can check out my portfolio, where I've curated a collection of my tech endeavors, each project telling a unique story of creativity and innovation.
